# Regularization Techniques in Machine Learning

Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This penalty term discourages overly complex models that may fit the training data too closely, thus improving the model's generalization performance on unseen data.

## Ridge Regression

Ridge Regression, also known as L2 regularization, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. The regularization term is represented as:


Loss = RSS + α * Σ(coefficients^2)

Where:
- RSS: Residual Sum of Squares 
- α (alpha): Regularization parameter that controls the strength of regularization. Higher α leads to more regularization, shrinking the coefficients towards zero.

    
Ridge regression encourages smaller coefficients, effectively reducing the impact of less important features. It can handle multicollinearity well by distributing the coefficient weights among correlated features.

Ridge Regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but it doesn't set them exactly to zero, allowing all features to contribute to the model. It's useful when dealing with multicollinearity (high correlation between predictors) as it tends to distribute the weights among correlated features evenly.

## Lasso Regression

Lasso Regression, also known as L1 regularization, adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. The regularization term is represented as:

Loss = RSS + α * Σ|coefficients|

Where:
- α is the regularization parameter.
  
Lasso regression has the effect of setting some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection by eliminating less important features. This makes Lasso regression particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets with many irrelevant or redundant features.

Lasso Regression not only shrinks the coefficients but can also set some of them to exactly zero. This property makes Lasso Regression useful for feature selection as it performs automatic feature selection by eliminating irrelevant or redundant features.

## Elastic Net Regression
Elastic Net regression combines the penalties of Ridge and Lasso regression. It adds both L1 and L2 penalty terms to the loss function, controlled by two regularization parameters: α and ρ.

Loss = RSS + α * ((1 - ρ) * Σ(coefficients^2) + ρ * Σ|coefficients|)

Where:
- α (alpha): Overall regularization parameter.
- ρ (rho): Mixing parameter that determines the balance between L1 and L2 regularization penalties.

- When ρ = 0, Elastic Net is equivalent to Ridge regression, and when ρ = 1, it is equivalent to Lasso regression.

Elastic Net combines the advantages of both Ridge and Lasso Regression. It handles multicollinearity like Ridge Regression and performs feature selection like Lasso Regression. However, it's computationally more expensive due to the presence of two regularization parameters.

These regularization techniques help to control the complexity of the model and improve its generalization performance, particularly when dealing with datasets with high dimensionality or multicollinearity.
