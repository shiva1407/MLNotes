# QLoRa: Efficient Fine-tuning Approach for Quantized Large Language Models (LLMs)

QLoRa is an efficient fine-tuning approach designed for quantized Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables users to fine-tune large language models, even those with 65B parameters or larger, on a single GPU, thereby significantly reducing the computational resources required.

## How does QLoRa work?

QLoRa operates through the following steps:

1. **Quantization:** QLoRa quantizes the LLM to 4-bit precision, effectively reducing the memory footprint of the model.
2. **Low-rank Adapter Weights:** Sparse learnable Low-rank Adapter weights are added to the quantized LLM. These adapters are updated during fine-tuning, allowing the LLM to maintain its performance.

## Benefits of QLoRa:

QLoRa offers several advantages:

- **Single GPU Fine-tuning:** It enables fine-tuning of large language models on a single GPU.
- **Performance Retention:** Despite quantization and sparse adapter weights, QLoRa ensures that the LLM retains its performance.
- **Ease of Use:** QLoRa is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward to implement.

## How to Use QLoRa?

QLoRa is available as an open-source project on GitHub. You can access the project [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314).

### Requirements:

To use QLoRa, ensure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.10 or higher
- Hugging Face Transformers

Once you have installed the requirements, refer to the QLoRa documentation for instructions on how to fine-tune your LLM using this approach.
